# This repository has a RESTFul API for Dealer and Listing entities

This project implements the use of a RESTFull API for Dealer and his/her Listing, inclusing supports the Controller Class for a complete and customized CRUD operations

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Technologies
* 1 - **String** Boot, Security and Data
* 2 - **Swagger** API Documentation
* 3 - **Dozer** Class converter
* 4 - **HATEAOS** Supports development of a RESTFul API 
* 5 - **Jackson** Allows requeste and response in xml, yaml, json format
* 6 - **JUnit** Test Class in Java Language
* 7 - **Mockito** Offers a library with different methods for performing and validating tests
* 8 - **REST Assured** Testing and validating REST services
* 9 - **Hamcrast** Testing and validating REST services

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture
This project was developed using the best practices in API RESTFUll development. The layers that make up the solution are listed and described below
* 1 - **Controller** In addition to implementing the endpoints for the services provided by the entity, this layer is responsible for converting the requests made in XML, JSON and YAML format to the format accepted by the backend and also converting responses to the format desired by the API user. 
* 2 - **ServiceVO** Responsible for converting VO class objects to entity classes recognized by the business layer. The VO layer implementation allows modifying the attributes of the inner classes for the user consuming the API. This new mapping increases the security of the application by hiding the real attributes of the business classes.
* 3 - **ServiceBO** In this layer are applied as business rules before the operations with the database, using a own repository data access class and other BO service classes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Technical Requirements

* 1 - MySQL Database (SGBD Tool)
* 2 - Java 11
* 3 - IDE Development. The project was developed Eclipse Version: 2020-06 (4.16.0) Build id: 20200615-1200
* 4 - The source code from https://github.com/edfcbz/task-api-rest-spring-360agency-test
* 5 - Database client as MySql Workbench. The project choose HeidiSQL 64 bits Version 11.0.0.5919 Build 2020-03-17 17:05:04
* 6 - Http request tool as Postman  


## üöÄ Starting Database and Environment
Fellow the below step for run the project

## üîß Development Environment Setup - DATABASE

* 1 - Install and Run the MySQL Server (Default port)
* 3 - Install and Run the HeidiSQL
  * 3.1 - In HeidiSQL run CreateDataBaseAndData.sql file (This step will create the SCHEMA and will insert basic data into tables). For it select: File -> Load SQL file -> Press SQL Execute (Blue Icon)
  * 3.2 - After prior step refresh environmet F5 key or press icon green (Refresh)
  * 3.3 - Verify if squema was created and tables has data 

## üîß Development Environment Setup - DEVELOPMENT

* 1 - Run Eclipse and Import the project as "Existing Maven Project" option
* 2 - In Eclipse menu select Project -> Clean
* 3 - Open package br.com.edfcbz and locate Statup.java file. Run it as Java Application. The TomCat server will run at 8080 port
  * 3.1 - Tips: If the Eclipse console show the message "Caused by: java.net.BindException: Address already in use: bind", finalize the service in 8080 port as showed
  * 3.2 - Run CMD as Administrator and type de command line: C:\>netstat -a -n -o | findstr :8080 (This command will show a line as:
          *TCP 0.0.0.0:8080 0.0.0.0:0 LISTENING 8457 (In this example 8457 is the PID process)
  * 3.3 - Run CMD command line as Administrator: C:\>taskKill.exe /F /PID 8457 ( This command will show a line as: 
          *SUCCESS: The process with PID 8457 was terminated. ( Or similar message )
  * 3.4 - Execute 3.1 step again

## ‚öôÔ∏è Testing environment
* 1 - Requesting a token (Security Layer)
  * 1.0 - Run Postman
  * 1.1 - Select a POST request and type http://localhost:8080/auth/signin
  * 1.2 - In Body section type: {
                          "username":"leandro",
                          "password":"admin123"
                        }
  * 1.3 - Select SEND button (You will receive a message with a token as below)

  * 1.4 - Copy the token returned without ""

* 2 - Requesting a TomCat service
  * 1.0 - Select a GET request and type http://localhost:8080
  * 1.1 - In Header section create a new Authorization key with value: Bearer <paste here token received in step 1.3>. Tip: There is just one empty space between Bearer and token
  * 1.2 - Select SEND button. You will receive all a list with services available, as showed in image below. So, your enviroment is running...

## üöÄ Starting JUnit Test Class
## Very Import Tip
* 1 - Before everything, execute section "Testing environment" Above. "THIS IS ESSENTIAL"
* 2 - (FIRST OPTION) Access the Database SQUEMA and remove all informations using the command SQL below:
  * 2.1 - Clean Listing table: DELETE FROM Listing;
  * 2.2 - Clean Dealer Table: DELETE FROM Dealer;
  * 2.3 - Execute the file InsertDataTestInTables.sql in Client SQL Tool (This step will create the data tests in Database squema)
* 3 - (SECOND OPTION) Creating new database
  * 3.1 - Remove the Database squema created before
  * 3.2 - Execute the SQL file "CreatingDatabase360agency.sql" in Client SQL Tool (This step will create the data tests in Database squema) 
  * 3.5 - Execute the SQL file "InsertDataTestInTables.sql" in Client SQL Tool (This step will create data in Squema Tables)  * 3 - * 3 - 
* 4 - Run the Sturtup.java class as java application. This file is located in br.com.edfcbz project package or repeat the "Testing environment" section 

## ‚öôÔ∏è API RESTFul - Running Examples
* 1 - **Dealer** endpoints
  * 1.1 - http://localhost:8080/dealer/ae8e9b8b-5a84-4140-84bd-f6e6ea1f57cd

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63114961/163649865-080a5c3d-a04e-4e2a-a840-f1496b78b66b.png) 
</br>This endpoint return all Dealer's Listing using Dealer Identifications as parameter in URL. See image for details


* 2 - **Listing** endpoints
  * 2.1 - Request GET http://localhost:8080/listing/dealerid/ae8e9b8b-5a84-4140-84bd-f6e6ea1f57cd/state/published **BUSINESS REQUIREMENT** This endpoint implements the Business Requirement, searching and returning all Listing of a Dealer and state of them
  * 

## ‚öôÔ∏è API RESTFul Test - Running Examples
As requirement, this project implemented JUnit test class for Dealer and Listing Service. Some tips are descrited below.

* 1 - **Dealer** endpoints. 
* Path classes in src/test/java/br/com/edfcbz/endpoint/dealer package 'Run the classes as JUnit tes'.
  * 1.1 - 'BaseClassAPITest.java class, conect with data base using user named leandro and password admin123. After that, receive a token to add in all request  
  * 1.2 - The DealerEndpointDifferentMethodologiesTest.java Class, test the Dealer endpoint using different methologies in tests.
  * 1.2 - The DealerEndpointTest.java class define the RestAssured given(), When() and Then() methologies
  
* 2 - **Listing** endpoints 'Run the classes as JUnit tests'
* Path classes in src/test/java/br/com/edfcbz/endpoint/listing package 
  * 2.1 - The DealerEndpointTest.java test class verify different Business aspect, including Listing bi Dealer and State   

Suite Class
* 3 - **Suite** This class test which runs all test class, been indicating before releases.
* Path classes in src/test/java/br/com/edfcbz/endpoint/suite package  
  * 3.1 -  Suite360AgenceTest.java class

## üìã API Development - Review Technical Aspect and Improvement Suggestions
* **1 - ListingServiceBO.java**
   * 1.1 - Method **public Listing update(Listing listing_)**
     The methody need some improvements in logical and structural aspect. Improvements in Dealer's Listing limit test (published)
   * 1.2 - Methody **public Listing published(String listingId)**
     With similar aspect with update methody, it's possible improve the Limit Listing test, creating a new method for test it.
   * 1.3 - Method **public void findDealerByDealerIdAndVerifyNameAndLimitListing()**
   
* **2 - Exception Classes**
   * 1.1 - Generalize and reduce the number of exception classes. It will be important to adopt a handle class that will be responsible for returning the appropriate exception class for each case.

## üìã API Test - Review Technical Aspect and Improvement Suggestions
* 1 - ListingEndpointTest.java
   * 1.1 - Method **public Listing update(Listing listing_)**
   * 1.2 - Method **public void findDealerByDealerIdAndVerifyNameAndLimitListing()**
   * 1.3 - Method **public void verifyDealerQuantity()**
In general, it will be beneficial to deepen the level of tests performed, especially when the returned object has a list in its body, such as, for example, the draft or published ads of a specific dealer
